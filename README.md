Linked lists are useful typically when the size of the structure needs to change dynamically, this is because of constant insertions and deletions. This could be used in apps like for example
Spotify, might want to use linked lists as they have the feature to remove and add songs whenever needed without changing everything.

The difference between stacks and queues is that stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out or LIFO rule, while on the other hand queues use First-In-First-Out or FIFO.

An example I saw of developers using stacks would be in recursive functions, in particular undo functionality as the last action that was done needs to be reversed which considering how stacks
behave would make it a good choice to use.

Arrays are more useful than lists in programs that need efficient use of indexed materials in a fixed manner, such as large mathematical computations.
